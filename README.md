## Readme

I don't think there's any extra build instructions besides `git clone`, `npm install`, and `npm run ios` but I haven't built/run this on any machine but my own. 

You may need to `cd ios` and run `pod install` or do `react-native link` from the root directory to get fonts installed properly. 

I used node version `v12.14.0` as nvm's `default` alias, which is important because Metro Bundler launches a new terminal, using whatever default version of node your system uses.

As far as I know, this only runs in an ios simulator, and I haven't even experimented with the Android side of things. 

I thought the time frame of 6 hours was a bit steep for a functionally complete, styled app, so I tried to front-load the work with some notes/thoughts to get the planning work done before the "dev" clock started. 

They're very train-of-thought and shouldn't be scrutinized too seriously. They can be found in `swstarter/notes.md`.
